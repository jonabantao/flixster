   - [x] (1pt) In portrait mode, the poster image, title, and movie overview is shown.
   - [x] (1pt) In landscape mode, the rotated alternate layout should use the backdrop image instead and show the title and movie overview to the right of it.

- [x] (2pts) Improved the user interface by experimenting with styling and coloring.
- [x] (2pts) For popular movies (movies rating higher than 7.5), the full backdrop image is displayed. Otherwise, a poster image, the movie title, and overview is listed. Use Heterogenous RecyclerViews and use different ViewHolder layout files for popular movies and less popular ones.

### Notes
 * Midway through thinking about styles in text, I noticed that there were preset defaults that were usable. Such as TextAppearance.Large.
 * Poster and backdrop width are hardcoded in the code. Image API endpoint lists an array of sizes for the images, but need to look into how to choose the best one for screen.
